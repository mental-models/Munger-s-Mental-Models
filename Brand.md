**Simply stated**: A brand is the public "face" of a firm. Historically, the firm's brand is made up by assets such as logos, trademarks and slogans that people associate with that firm ([Investopedia] (http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand.asp)). The notion of "brand" has evolved to include a firm's behavior, as seen in its employee actions, customer service interactions and social media presence.

**Simply applied**: Post-modern philosophy and culture has pushed idea of "brand" beyond firmsâ€”every*thing* and every*one* can be said to have a brand. In our consumption-driven society, brand has come to symbolize not only differentiation among products, but reputation within culture and society.
