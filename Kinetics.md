**Simply stated**: Chemical kinetics studies the rate of chemical processes ([Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_kinetics)). Kinetics studies the speed of chemical reactions and models how they occur. A number of things effect reaction rates, including the substances in the reaction, their physical state (*i.e.*, solid, liquid, gas), surface area, concentration, temperature, pressure and substances that can speed the rate of reaction ("catalysts").

**Simply applied**: Just as we saw in the [Autocatalytic Reaction] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Autocatalytic-Reaction.md) mental model, the adoption of cultural and technological products seems relevant here. Not only do we have visualizations like bell curves and s-curves help us to depict the rate of adoption, we also understand that any number of factors can speed or slow the rate of change (language, geography, politics, etc.) and can adjust the forecasting models we create to account for them.
