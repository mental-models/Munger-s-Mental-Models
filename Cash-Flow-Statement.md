**Simply Stated**: a document that should the amount of cash and cash equivalents (*e.g.*, money owed or expected, expenses, assets with value, value lost by those assets over time) going in and out of a company. Cash flow is shown in three major areas:
* Operations—changes in cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, depreciation or inventory
* Investing—changes in the value of equipment, assets or other investments
*  Financing—changes in debt, loans or dividends 

**Simply Applied**: this document is interesting because is less of a static picture that the balance sheet—there's *directionality* to it. Indeed it's more of a GIF, as you have a sense of how the money is flowing inside of the organization. You also get a sense for the firm's priorities, successes and struggles. If in the context of a public filing like SEC forms 10-K or 10-Q, there's actual commentary to accompany the tables. For private companies and tables without context, you're left to do the detective work yourself.

SEC's [EDGAR](http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html) can be used to look up public filings. [Mattermark](https://mattermark.com/) may be a reference for many private tech companies.
