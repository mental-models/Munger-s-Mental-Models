**Simply stated**: Physiology studies how the organisms and the biological structures that they're made of—cells, tissues, organs and organ systems—carry out the chemical and biological functions they use to live. ([Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection)). Techniques like dissection and magnification help people observe and understand those biological functions.

**Simply applied**: Think of how people in your field understand how that field's core components and concepts function. Is your understanding simply received wisdom, is it the result of a more formal understanding? Systems can be analyzed with tools (logic, spreadsheets, primary and secondary research techniques) that allow you to zoom into or cut through things to gain an understanding for how they work.
