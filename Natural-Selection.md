**Simply stated**: Natural selection describes how observable characteristics seen within a group of individuals changes over time as they reproduce, based on conditions that exist in their environment. Within any group, there are variations on a certain observable characteristic ("phenotype") common to that group that can persist over time, across generations. Environmental conditions can act to increase the likelihood that individuals with a certain phenotype survive in greater numbers, allowing that characteristic to be seen more within that group over time.

**Simply applied**: Natural selection can be used as a framework to think about not just biological organisms, but other groups as well. Conditions like geography, climate, government and culture can work to effect how groups of anything—from concepts to companies—look, act and survive in future generations. Think of the characteristics that help types of ideas, teams and insitutions survive, as well as the roadblocks that could prevent their success.
