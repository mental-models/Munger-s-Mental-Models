**Simply stated**: in quantum physics, we cannot measure the position and momentum of an subatomic particle with absolute precision. Indeed, the more accurately we measure one of these values, the less accurately we know the other ([Guardian] (https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/10/what-is-heisenbergs-uncertainty-principle)). As subatomic articles move with such speed and interact with surrounding particles, it is very difficult to observe them. This principle is now thought to be an inherent aspect of matter, which can act as both a wave *and* a particle, rather than an artifact of our ability to observe the particles using scientific instruments that alter its environment (see the [observer effect] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics))). So not very simple at all.

**Simply applied:** This is a tough one to extrapolate into metaphor, outside of its obvious power as a way to explain the world. So as not to get lost in the physics, let's say that, as we measure a given value of a thing in a system, we need to add in a margin of error since many other parts of the system can act upon that thing to effect the value we're measuring, especially if we're optimizing for a particular value. Another elegant way of thinking about this for the economics-minded among us is [Goodhart's Law] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law): *when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to become a good measure*.
