**Simply stated**: a branch of science that explores the relationship between heat, temperature, energy and work ([Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics#Chemical_thermodynamics)). They are governed by four laws that explain their behavior, regardless of the particular system in which they are observed:
* *Zeroth Law—if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other* ( underpins the other laws, while also providing an empirical definition of temperature).
* *First Law—the internal energy of an isolated system is constant* 
(energy can transfer, but is neither created nor destroyed).
* *Second Law—heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder location to a hotter location* 
(over time, differences in temperature, pressure and chemical potential tend to even out in an isolated physical system—expressing the principle of *decay*).
* *Third Law—as a system approaches absolute zero, all processes cease and the entropy of the system approaches a minimum value*
(is a reference point for determining the *[entropy] (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/entropy)* of a system, which is, broadly, the degree of disorder or uncertainty within it).

From a [chemical perspective] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_thermodynamics#Overview), it describes the study of how heat and work interrelate in chemical reactions, particularly for predicting energy exchanges during different chemical processeses—including phase changes and solutions formation—within a system.

**Simply applied**: Thermodynamics has a huge impact on systems theory, as it helps to describe how things inside and outside of the system interact.
