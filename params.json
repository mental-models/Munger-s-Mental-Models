  "body": "#About This Reference\r\n[Mental models] (https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/) are \"the big ideas from the big disciplines: physics, biology, psychology, philosophy, literature, sociology, history, and a few others.\" These foundational concepts help to explain the world around us and make us better thinkers.\r\n\r\nThis list is compiled from Tren Griffin's list of models [here] (http://25iq.com/2015/08/22/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-charlie-munger-about-mental-models-and-worldly-wisdom/). Each model is described with a Wikipedia introduction level of specificityâ€”indeed, most definitions will reference Wikipedia unless otherwise stated. I will then note any additional relevant thoughts around each model, as well as a musing or two on how it could be applicable beyond business and investing to knowledge work more broadly.\r\n\r\nPlease add your commentary! I would love for this to be a \"living list\" of concepts that benefit from multiple perspectives.\r\n\r\n\r\n#The Models\r\n\r\n###Accounting\r\n* [Balance Sheet] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Balance-Sheet.md)\r\n* [Cash Flow Statement] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Cash-Flow-Statement.md)\r\n* [Depreciation] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Depreciation.md)\r\n* [Double-Entry] (<https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Double-Entry.md)\r\n* [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/GAAP.md)\r\n* [Income Statement] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Income-Statement.md)\r\n* [Sunk Cost] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Sunk-Cost.md)\r\n\r\n###Biology\r\n* [Genetics] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Genetics.md)\r\n* [Natural Selection] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Natural-Selection.md)\r\n* [Physiology] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Physiology.md)\r\n\r\n###Business\r\n* [Moats] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Moat.md)\r\n* [Five Forces] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Five-Forces.md)\r\n* [Brand] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Brand.md)\r\n\r\n###Chemistry\r\n* [Autocatalytic Reaction] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Autocatalytic-Reaction.md)\r\n* [Bohr Model] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Bohr-model.md)\r\n* [Kinetics] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Kinetics.md)\r\n* [Thermodynamics] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Thermodynamics.md)\r\n* [Uncertainty Principle] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Uncertainty-Principle.md)\r\n* [Viscosity] (https://github.com/lloyd2nd/Munger-s-Mental-Models/blob/master/Viscosity.md)",
