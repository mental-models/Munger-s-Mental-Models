**Simply stated**: The model is a historical method of visualizing the atomic structure of chemical elements. In it, a small nucleus is surrounded by a number of electrons that travel in circular orbit around the nucleus, much like our solar system ([Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model)). Although there are more accurate representations, the Bohr model is often used to introduce students to atomic structure.

**Simply applied**: A Bohr model visualization is a convenient way to depict concepts where a single core idea is surrounded by other componentsâ€”much in the same way a "hub-and-spoke" visualization does. It also shows how to depict a wide variety of things through a common visual language that reveals their underlying components. Do you use similar models in your work or study?
