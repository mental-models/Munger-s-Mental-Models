**Simply stated**: A chemical reaction in which a product of a reaction of two or more molecules (or "reactants") is itself a part (a "catalyst") of that  reaction. ([Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis)). A key aspect of this reaction is its *non-linearity*—the reaction doesn't grow at a steady rate, but tends to start slow, ramp up as more of the catalyst is created, and eventually slows down as the amount of non-catalyst reactant decreases.

**Simply applied**: Two aspects of this reaction are particularly interesting. First, the notion of a catalyst is particularly relevant for thinking about network effects, as people are a catalyst for growth—if someone's friends and family are participants, those people are more likely to participate, too. Second, when those networks grow, that growth often (though not always) takes the shape of an [s-curve] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function). This sort of curve is not only relevant to visualizing network effects, but adoption curves more generally—for instance, how long it takes for a new technology/product to saturate the public/marketplace.
