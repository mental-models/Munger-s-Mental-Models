**Simply stated**: The Five Forces model created by [Michael Porter] (https://twitter.com/MichaelEPorter) describes five areas that shape a firm's potential for success in any industry:

1. Competition within the industry
2. Potential of new entrants into the industry
3. Power of suppliers
4. Power of customers
5. Threat of substitute products

This model is often used by firms to analyze sources of profitability within an industry to develop their own corporate strategy. ([Investopedia] (http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/porter.asp?ad=dirN&qo=serpSearchTopBox&qsrc=1&o=40186)).

**Simply applied**: The Five Forces model is a popular strategic tool because it gives a high-level view of things that can impact a firm. This model could be used by any organization that wants to both get a sense of their competitive landscape and find new opportunities.
