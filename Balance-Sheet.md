**Simply stated**: "A financial statement that summarizes a company's assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity at a specific point in time. These three balance sheet segments give investors an idea as to what the company owns and owes, as well as the amount invested by shareholders." ([Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/balancesheet.asp))

Like many financial concepts, it can be expressed mathematically:

*Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity*

Assets are monies and things of value owned by the firm. Liabilities are monies owed to outside parties. Shareholder's Equity is additional money put into the firm by its owners, like earnings reinvested into the business or additional capital owners have put into the company when they purchased stock.  

This equation both describes and commands. To understand how the firm is doing, the balance sheet shows it. To correctly determine the financial position of a firm, one must use the equation.

**Simply applied**: A balance sheet is a pretty utilitarian document. It is a succinct expression of how a firm is doing. You might just be reading it to better understand how your business, the competition's business, or a business your interested in is performing. For those trying to get a sense of where a firm's strengths and weaknesses are, this document can help you get an idea.

One interesting thing that can be said for itâ€”the common metaphor you hear used to describe it is a "picture" or "snapshot." Each field has its own way to describe the state of a system.
